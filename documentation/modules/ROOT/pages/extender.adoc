== `BundleManifestScanner`

You should use the `BundleManifestScanner` if you wish to implement an extender that is triggered by existence of specific entries in bundle manifest (`META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`).

Usually in your extender `BundleActivator` you will create and start an instance of `BundleWatcher` by passing in a `BundleManifestScanner` and your extender specific `BundleObserver`.

[source, java]
----
new BundleWatcher<ManifestEntry>(
    bundleContext,
    // bundle manifest scanner
    new BundleManifestScanner(...),
    // customizer for scanned entries
    new BundleObserver<ManifestEntry>() {
        public void addingEntries(Bundle bundle, List<ManifestEntry> entries) {
            // your specific code, doing something with the manifest entries
        }
        public void removingEntries(Bundle bundle, List<ManifestEntry> entries) {
            // revert actions (if required)
        }
    }
);

=== `BundleManifestScanner`

This scanner takes the starting bundle manifest entries and makes use of provided `ManifestFilter` to find out if the current bundle manifest contains expected entries.
If there are any entries matched by the manifest filter it will create for each one a `ManifestEntry` which is a simple pair between manifest header name and value.
Below is an example of creating a `BundleManifestScanner` that uses a regular expression based manifest filter:

[source, java]
----
new BundleManifestScanner(
    new RegexKeyManifestFilter(
        "Bundle-.*"
    )
);
----

=== `ManifestFilter`

Manifest filters scope is to filter the manifest entries to the set required by your extender.
You can implement your own filter and/or make use of the built-in ones:

* `RegexKeyManifestFilter` â€” matches manifest headers name against a regular expression
* ... more to come

== `BundleURLScanner`

You should use the `BundleURLScanner` if you wish to implement an extender that is triggered by existence of specific files or directories in bundles.

=== Example WAR Extender

The following is an example of how you can implement an extender bundle for war files:

----
new BundleWatcher<URL>(
    bundleContext,
    new BundleURLScanner(
        "WEB-INF/",
        "web.xml",
        false // do not recurse
    ),
    new BundleObserver<URL>() {
        public void addingEntries(Bundle bundle, List<URL> entries) {
            // process web xml, as for example parsing and registering servlets
        }

        public void removingEntries(Bundle bundle, List<URL> entries) {
            // revert processing of web xml
        }
    }
).start();
