== Utilities for OSGi

Pax Swissbox is a set of utilities targeting OSGi and the project emerged as means for re-usage within Pax projects.
But, as Pax Swissbox artifacts are generic, they can be reused outside Pax projects.
In order to minimize dependencies and improve modularity Pax Swissbox is split in very fine-grained bundles that you can use individually.
Pax Swissbox artifacts are meant to be embedded (wrapped) in your bundle (easy to achieve using Maven Bundle Plugin), but you can use them as standalone bundles.
